<section name="Proposal for your-project Package">



<subsection name="(0) Rationale">

<p>What does the <em>your-project</em> Package provide?</p>


</subsection>
<subsection name="(1) Scope of the Package">

<p>Commons projects should have a tight scope, so define that scope here. </p>

</subsection>
<subsection name="(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages">

<p><em>your-project</em> relies only on standard JDK 1.2 (or later) APIs for
production deployment.  It utilizes the JUnit unit testing framework for
developing and executing unit tests, but this is of interest only to
developers of the component. </p>

<p>No external configuration files are utilized.</p>


</subsection>
<subsection name="(2) Initial Source of the Package">

<p>Where did the source code from your-project come from? </p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.lc-your-project</code>.</p>


</subsection>
<subsection name="(3)  Required Jakarta-Commons Resources">

<ul>
<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>lc-your-project</code> in the
    <code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>dev@commons.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [lc-your-project].</li>
<li>Bugzilla - New component "your-project" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
</ul>


</subsection>
<subsection name="(4) Initial Committers">

<p>The initial committers on the your-project component shall be as follows:
<ul>
<li>Your Name Here (ynhere)</li>
</ul>
</p>
